# Data Analysis using SQL



## Indian Census Data Analysis for 2011
In this project, I have used two datasets related to Indian census . One dataset contains literacy rate and population growth data for each state and the other contains state and district wise population. I have imported the datasets into an SQL database and perform the tasks  to find important insights from this dataset.


## About the Data
The first CSV file is for population growth data and it has information of all the states with literacy rate,sex ratio and growth rate.

The second file contains population  data for each district and also consists of area of each district.
## Tasks
1)Find number of rows in the dataset

2)Show the data for two states Jharkhand and Bihar

3)Show total population of India

4)Show average growth of population 

5)Show average sex ratio

6)Show states which have average literacy rate greater than 90

7)Show top 3 states with highest growth ratio

8)Show bottom 5 States with least literacy rate

9)Create a temporary table to show top 3 states and bottom 3 states by literacy rate

10)Show states starting with letter 'A'

11)Show total males and females

12)Show the population in previous census

13)Output top 3 districts from each state with highest literacy rate
